## Overview

**_Tuner_** is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/louis77/tuner), packaged as a Flatpak and distributed by Flathub. **_Tuner_** is writen in [Vala](https://vala.dev/), a C#/Java/JavaFX-like language with a self-hosting compiler that generates C code and uses the GObject type system and wrapping a number of GTK libraries. It uses [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) as its build system.

**_Tuner_** has not undergone a lot of attention in a while, and would benefit from a review with an eye to refactoring and cleaning up the code, while in the short term addressing known bugs and fixing basic functional issues, documentation and also making it easier to build and test.

## Tuner Development
Hosted on Github, the _main_ branch reflects the current stable release. The _development_ branch is the development branch and where releases are staged. Pull Requests should be made against the _development_ branch.

### Dependencies

Development dependencies for Tuner are:
```bash
granite
gstreamer-1.0
gstreamer-player-1.0
gtk+-3.0
json-glib-1.0
libgee-0.8
libsoup-3.0
meson
vala
```

Install required dependencies (Debian/Ubuntu):
```bash
sudo apt install git valac meson
sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libgee-0.8-dev libgranite-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-dev libsoup-3.0-dev libjson-glib-dev
```

### Building the Tuner App From Source
There are two build configurations: _debug_ and _release_. The _debug_ build (manifest _com.github.louis77.tuner.debug.yml_) is recommended for development, while the _release_ build (manifest _com.github.louis77.tuner.yml_) is for distribution. Build instructions will focus on the _debug_ build. Copy the required manifest to _com.github.louis77.tuner.xml_ before building.


Clone the repo and drop into the Tuner directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/louis77/tuner.git
cd tuner
```

Configure Meson for development debug build, build Tuner with Ninja, and run the result:
```bash
meson setup --buildtype=debug builddir
meson compile -C builddir
meson install -C builddir     # only needed once to get the gschema in place
./builddir/com.github.louis77.tuner
```

Tuner can be deployed to the local system to bypass flatpak if required, however it is _recommended to use flatpak_.To do deploy locally, run the following command:
```bash
meson configure -Dprefix=/usr
sudo ninja install
```

## Valadoc
valadoc --force --pkg gtk+-3.0 --pkg glib-2.0 --pkg gee-0.8 --pkg gio-2.0 --pkg libsoup-3.0 --pkg json-glib-1.0 --pkg gstreamer-1.0 --pkg gstreamer-player-1.0 --pkg granite --package-name=Tuner -o apidocs  --verbose src/**/*.vala


### Building the Tuner Flatpak
Tuner uses the __elementary.io__ platform, version __8__. To build the tuner flatpak, install the elementry SDK and Platform:
```bash
apt-get install flatpak-builder
flatpak remote-add --user --if-not-exists elementary https://flatpak.elementary.io/repo.flatpakrepo
flatpak install elementary io.elementary.Sdk//8 io.elementary.Platform//8
```

Build the flatpak in the _user_ scope:
```bash
flatpak-builder --force-clean --user --sandbox --install build-dir com.github.louis77.tuner.debug.yml
```

Run the Tuner flatpack:
```bash
flatpak --user run com.github.louis77.tuner
```
Check the app version to ensure that it matches the version in the manifest.

### Readying code for a Pull Request
Before a pull request can be accepted, the code must pass linting. This is done by running the following command:
```bash
flatpak run --command=flatpak-builder-lint org.flatpak.Builder manifest com.github.louis77.tuner.yml
```

Linting currently produces the following issues (adddressed in ticket #140): 
```json
{
    "errors": [
        "appid-uses-code-hosting-domain"
    ],
    "info": [
        "appid-uses-code-hosting-domain: github.com"
    ],
    "message": "Please consult the documentation at https://docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/linter"
}
```
Ensure that the CI checks pass before pushing your changes.


### NamingConventions

Going forward, all new code should conform to the following naming conventions:

- Namespaces are named in camel case: NameSpaceName
- Classes are named in camel case: ClassName
- Method names are all lowercase and use underscores to separate words: method_name
- Constants (and values of enumerated types) are all uppercase, with underscores between words: CONSTANT_NAME 
- Public properties are named in camel case: propertyName
- Private member variables are named all lowercase and use underscores to separate words prefixed with an underscore: _var_name

<!---- Signals are named all lowercase and use underscores to separate words postfixed with \_sig: propertyName_sig -->


## Debugging 

### VSCode 
Debugging from VSCode using GDB, set up the launch.json file as follows:
```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [    
    {
      "name": "Debug Vala with Meson",
      "type": "cppdbg",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/builddir/com.github.louis77.tuner",
      "args": [],
      "stopAtEntry": false,
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "environment": [],
      "externalConsole": false,
      "MIMode": "gdb",
      "miDebuggerPath": "/usr/bin/gdb",
      "setupCommands": [
        {
          "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
          "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
          "ignoreFailures": true
        }
      ],
      "preLaunchTask": "meson build"
    }
  ]
}
```
_Note:_ Variables appear as pointers, and generated code is not found. Please submit a better config if you have one.

### Bug Introduction Deduction
Knowing when a bug was introduced requires building previous versions and looking for the aberrent behavior. The following commands can be used to check out previous versions of the code:
```bash
git fetch
git tag
git checkout <tag>
```
After checking out the required version, build and run the app as described above.


## Release Process
Releasing _Tuner_ comprises cutting a release of the code in [tuner github](https://github.com/louis77/tuner) and then updating the [flathub repo](https://github.com/flathub/com.github.louis77.tuner) which will automatically have the flatpak generated and rolled to Flathub for distribution.

### Beta Releases
Beta releases should be tagged from the Tuner _development_ branch in with a version number format of _v1.\*.\*-beta.\*_ 

Once a beta release has been tagged, the Flathub _beta_ branch can be updated via a pull request with the _beta_ tag going into the manifest _.json_, and any patches and documentation updated as needed. The pull request will trigger a flathub build, but will not merge the pull request - pull requests should be merged only if they result in a successful build. 

Once the beta is successfully built by flathub it will be available for installation and testing within the user community. 

Once a beta roll is deamed a success its pull request can be merged, and a production release can be rolled.

### Production Releases
Production releases are generated from _development_ pull requests into _main_. The updated _main_ branch should be tagged with a version number format of _v1.\*.\*_ 

Once a release has been tagged, the [flathub repo](https://github.com/flathub/com.github.louis77.tuner) _main_ branch can be updated with the _release_ tag going into the manifest _.json_, and any patches and documentation updated as needed. Updates from the _main_ branch should be copied in from a direct _pull request_ of the _main_ branch. The _main_ branch **should not** come from a merge _beta_ branch to avoid triggering subsequent builds in _beta_ .

Once the main production release is built by flathub it will be available for installation and automatically distributed to user community.
